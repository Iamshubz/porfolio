        <p>As a Coordinator at GDSC MIT-A, I have successfully managed multiple events, such as the Cloud Jam Session, tech talk sessions, and more. I also won the Eco-Tech GFG hackathon. I have contributed to the development of several web applications using HTML, CSS, Python, and C, and have gained valuable skills in web design and development.

            In addition, I am a Campus Ambassador at Rendezvous IITDelhi, where I represent and promote one of the largest cultural festivals in India. I engage with students, sponsors, and media to create awareness and excitement. I have also completed a two-month internship as a UI Designer at CodSoft, where I designed user-friendly and responsive interfaces for various clients, applying the principles of UI/UX design to create engaging and intuitive user experiences.
            
            Furthermore, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering at Maharashtra Institute of Technology Aurangabad, where I have acquired a strong foundation in programming, data structures, algorithms, and cloud security. I have also earned certifications in Geo-Data Sharing and Cyber Security, Web Design & Development, and Learning the OWASP Top 10, which demonstrate my interest and proficiency in these domains.
            
            My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to create innovative and impactful solutions that can solve real-world problems and improve people's lives. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools and to collaborate with other professionals and enthusiasts who share my vision and passion. I believe that with hard work, creativity, and teamwork, anything is possible.
